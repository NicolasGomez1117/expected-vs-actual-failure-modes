# failure-shape-alignment

This repository presents a small, public-facing synthesis that aligns:

- structural failure shapes (ERC-8004 as an abstract schema)
- temporal observability signals (accrual lag as a conditioning lens)

It is designed to be read, not run. There is no code, tooling, or automation.

## Scope
- One historical incident: Wormhole 2022
- One derived artifact: a single JSON record used as supporting evidence
- Short interpretive documents that specify projections, conditioning, and limits

## Non-goals
- No exploit analysis or reconstruction
- No predictions or scoring
- No alerts, mitigation advice, or operational guidance
- No private lab structure, monitoring scaffolding, or internal canon

## Reading order (under 10 minutes)
