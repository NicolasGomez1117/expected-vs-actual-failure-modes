# Accrual conditioning (temporal lens)

Accrual is used here as a temporal lens: evidence arrives over time, and the timing of that arrival conditions what can be responsibly inferred.

## Conditioning intent
- Early signals are partial and may be unstable.
- Later signals reduce ambiguity, but do not determine cause.
- Accrual narrows the set of plausible failure shapes without identifying which one occurred.

## Interpretive boundary
This repository does not define thresholds, alerts, or actions. It records how the timing of evidence changes interpretability while preserving uncertainty.
