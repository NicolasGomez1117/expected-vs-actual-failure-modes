# Wormhole 2022 — overview

This repository references the 2022 Wormhole incident as a single historical case. The description here is intentionally minimal and evidence-first.

## Factual frame
- The incident is treated as a completed historical event.
- The repository does not attempt to explain causes, attacker behavior, or exploit mechanics.

## Observable evidence
The only supporting evidence in this repository is a derived JSON record. That record indicates the presence of event and state artifacts associated with the incident and records the terminal state as unknown.

## Terminal state: unknown
The terminal state is explicitly marked `unknown` because the evidence here is limited to a small, derived record. This repository does not resolve outcomes or infer intent; it documents uncertainty as part of the abstraction.
